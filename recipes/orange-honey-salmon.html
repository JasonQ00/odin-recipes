    <h4>Crispy skinned, sweet honey salmon</h4>
      <p>Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.</p>

    <h4>How to make Crispy Skinned Orange Honey Salmon!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
    <br>
         <li><strong>Preheat</strong> large cast iron skillet in the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
         <li><strong>Remove</strong> skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet.</li>
    <br>
         <li><strong>Bake</strong> in the hot oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>      
    </ol>
