        <h4>A beautiful bowl of Beef and Lentil stew</h4>
        <p>Here’s a different beef mince recipe idea for you – a hearty Beef & Lentil Soup with vegetables! Adapted from my Best Ever Lentil Soup with the addition of ground beef and Moroccan-inspired spicing for extra tastiness, lentil soups can be so boring … but not this one!
            Healthy, hearty, economical and a complete dinner made in one pot. Yessss…..</p>
            <br>

                <li>Ground beef</li>

        <h4>How to make Beef and Lentil stew!</h4>        
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix the spices</strong> in a bowl first – We’re going to use some to brown the beef, and some to flavour the soup broth;</li>
            <br>
                <li><strong>Cook onion, beef –</strong> Sauté the onion and garlic (essential flavour base!) then brown the beef, breaking it up as you go (flat edge wooden spatula makes short work of this);</li>
            <br>
                <li><strong>Brown beef with spices –</strong> Add some of the spices and cook it with the beef. Here we add a ton of extra flavour into this soup, so cook off those spices well! Have a nibble and make sure it’s tasty, then tweak as needed. Some of the flavour will seep into the soup, but most stays on the beef;</li>
            <br>
                <li><strong>Add everything else –</strong> Add the vegetables that can sustain a 25 minute simmer along with all the broth ingredients (tomato, beef stock, water, remaining spices) and give it big stir;</li>
            <br>
                <li><strong>immer for 25 – 30 minutes</strong> for the lentils to soften and tomato to break down so it thickens the sauce. <strong>TIP:</strong> Older dried lentils take longer to cook, so really old ones might take 35 minutes. Add the faster-cooking vegetables partway through, and based on how long they take to cook. I added the diced zucchini and green beans after 15 minutes – so they cooked for 10 minutes. This was more than sufficient to cook them through until soft and to soak up broth flavour; and</li>
            <br>
                <li><strong>Serve! </strong> Because I went for a Moroccan flavour for the base recipe, I finished with a dollop of yogurt and some fresh coriander. I will pop a list of suggested finishes for other spice mix combinations in the recipe card.</li>
